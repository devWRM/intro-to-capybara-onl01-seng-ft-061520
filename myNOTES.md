learn --f-f     <= does not work
To TEST use:
    bundle exec rspec

Note: If you're getting an error about conflicting gems, you may need to run bundle exec rspec (or bundle exec learn). Prepending a command with bundle exec forces your terminal to run the process with the version of the gems specified in the gem file rather than just using the most recent versions on your machine. If this still does not fix the error, try bundle update
